# CS182 Final Project
To create our visualizations, we used the Visualizations.ipynb notebook with our specific directories in google drive.
We used a lot of models we created from our experiments to create the visualizations but we can't upload them all to github as some are very large so we just uploaded two.
To create the our training and test data we downloaded the course notes from each class we used and passed them through our data pipelines which are stored in the Data Processing folder.
