How do you get started
The first step in any project is to set a goal, no matter if it is to solve the equation, analyze the issue or create a new concept. In the case of building a learning app, the goal is to understand basic algebra, linear algebra, and advanced math concepts. Once the project and the goal are agreed upon, the design phase of the project can begin. All it takes is a brainstorming session using Microsoft Excel, Word or any other text editing software. The user comes up with an idea for the app design and then breaks it down into steps, based on the needs of the final result.
For example, let's say you want to come up with a game that will help kids develop skills in math. The core concept is to use"

But, there is strong evidence that people with dyslexia are especially susceptible to its effects.

In the 1970's, studies started showing that dyslexic adults have a significantly impaired ability to encode and access symbols from their environment.  The same effect was shown in children whose intelligence was low or missing or who were reading with dyslexia.
