Students need to use what they're familiar with not how they'd be taught in a classroom. Make use of the information as new, while incorporating the context within that context. You can create a new vocabulary and name each term based on the context in your study. Once students do this, you can easily introduce it into the lesson using new terms at the beginning of each lesson.

Solution:

Translation of the problem (not hard to solve):


In English, the base letters (which is the actual base type of your language and is only determined by letters being in your language) and the numbers are all written the same way. So the difficulty depends on the difficulty of that base type and not on the English letters.

Let us see if the english letters (they don't have any characters in different ways) have any chance of being easier than the other letters
